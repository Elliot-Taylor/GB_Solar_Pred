    "### 1) Background\n",
    "Solar power and renewable energy production in general will become an essential part of the world of tomorrow and in some places already is. As countries move forward towards cleaner power grids the  Knowing and understanding how much power can be generated based on given conditions will allow for smarter power grids which can allocate and depend on certain resources based on the conditions of that day. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see below renewable power generation the in UK has increased greatly over the past 10 years, with solar power being introduced in 2010. As the UK has rattified the Paris Agreement in 2016 it has committed to reduce it's green house gas emissions, a key part of this will be renewable energy."

    "### 2) Problem\n",
    "This project aims to take data from the UK between 2015-2016 to understand and model the solar power generation. In a real world project a model such as this would allow power companies to predict how much power they could generate through renewable sources and depending on that increase or reduce the amount produced from non renewable sources. Therefore the problem I aim to solve is on a given day how much power can be expected to be produced by the UK's solar power grid."

These datasets have a single row for every hour from the 1st of January 2015 to the 31st of December 2016, this means a total of 17544 entries with 8 variables for each entry. The target of the project will be the solar generation with the other columns acting as features to predict the generation. "

Therefore the column names where reduced to: Temp, Rad_Direct, Rad_Diffuse, Load_Actual, Load_Forecast, Price_Day_Ahead, and Solar_Cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next in Price_Day_Ahead there were 49 empty entries therefore these rows where dropped, this is because 49 entries only represents a little over 2 days of data and will have relatively low impact on the dataset as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the Timestamp column was converted into a Timestamp dtype, although Timestamp will not be used in the final model this makes working with the data for exploration easier.\n"

    "\n",
    "First off below you can see our variables across the two years. Predictable temperature and radiance show higher values during the summer months with significatly lower values during winter. Less predictably the oposite can be said for both load variables this is most likely because in the UK during winter electric heating systems will be used to heat homes and businesses, however unlike countries with warmer more humid climates during summer air conditioning is rarely used in homes in the UK. Price day ahead shows a relatively flat line with little variation across 2015 although in the later half of 2016 there appears to be more variation. Finally solar capacity shows 3 plateaus with very minor increases across the 2 years, only shows sizable increases in the spring of each year. \n"

In contrast rad direct and diffuse both have the same source and units, however they show a much lower correlation which suggests that there may be information to gain from each of them. We will explore the val ue of each variable and the information they provide later on as we look at feature selection.\n"

    "Contrary to the correlation matrix above a point load actual appears to have a weak negative linear relationship above around 1000MW solar generation, an explanation for this could be the opposing annual fluxtuations in each with solar generation being greatest in summer when load is lowest and vice versa. A similar relationship can be seen with load forecast.\n",

    "#### Price day ahead\n",
    "\n",

As we can see price day ahead has the lowest relative importance therefore we will remove it from our feature list. \n",

There we will perform some statistical analysis to confirm whether there is a statistically significant difference between the variables. First for most statistical tests there is the assumption that the variables are approximately normal. Luckly as show below both variables have a close to normal distribution, therfore we can perform a t test on them to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the two variables.\n",
